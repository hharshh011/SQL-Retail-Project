# SQL-Retail-Project

1. **Business Context**: The goal is to derive insights into customer behavior using data from three tables:
   - **Customer**: Customer demographics.
   - **Transactions**: Transaction details.
   - **Product Category**: Information about product categories and subcategories.

2. **Data Relationships**: A diagram illustrates the relationships among the three tables.

3. **Tasks**:
   - **Data Preparation**: Queries involve counting rows, identifying transaction returns, fixing date formats, analyzing transaction time ranges, and identifying category-subcategory mappings.
   - **Data Analysis**: Queries include identifying transaction channels, gender-based customer counts, customer distribution by city, product and revenue-related insights, sales performance across categories, and high-level customer activity (e.g., customers with more than 10 transactions).

4. **Key Metrics**: Specific questions focus on revenue, sales percentages, return percentages, store-type performance, and category-based averages.

The document requires single SQL queries for each task and emphasizes read-only database access.
